Standard Specifications
Timestamp

The ACCESS-TIMESTAMP in request signatures is in milliseconds.Requests are rejected if the timestamp deviates by over 30 seconds from the API server time. If the local server time deviates significantly from the API server time, we recommend updating the HTTP header by querying the API server time.

Rate limiting rules

Too frequent requests will be rate-limited automatically and return the 429 status code in the HTTP header.

Public endpoints (such as market data endpoints): Uniform frequency of up to 20 requests per 2 seconds.
Authorization endpoints: Rate limits are based on the API key (see endpoint-specific rules).
Request formats

Only two request methods are supported: GET and POST

GET: Parameters are sent via queryString in the path to the server.
POST: Parameters are sent as a JSON-formatted body to the server.
